## Introduction

Text classification is a common natural language processing (NLP) task used to categorize text documents into predefined categories. In this project, we apply text classification techniques to consumer complaints data to classify complaints into different product categories.

## Dataset

We used the [Consumer Complaint Database](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/consumer-complaint-database) dataset from [data.gov](https://data.gov) for this project. The dataset contains consumer complaints with various attributes, including product descriptions and narratives.

## Prerequisites

To run the code in this repository, you need to have the following prerequisites:

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- Libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, nltk, and joblib

To install the necessary libraries, run the following command:
